The SLMS incorporates key features such as member management, book management, and issue and return functionalities. Moreover, it integrates Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to streamline book tracking and enhance the user borrowing experience. Through a phased approach encompassing system design, implementation, and testing, significant progress has been made towards the development of the SLMS. This project holds promise in revolutionizing library management, empowering librarians with advanced tools to optimize collections and deliver superior services to patrons.
